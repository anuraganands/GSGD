Guided Stochastic Gradient Descent (GSGD)

Copyright (c) 2018, Anuraganand Sharma - All rights reserved.

This Matlab code is the implementation of GSGD proposed by Anuraganand Sharma in the paper:
A. Sharma, “Guided Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm for inconsistent datasets,” 
Applied Soft Computing, vol. 73, pp. 1068–1080, Dec. 2018 

How to run:
1 - The main program is written in GSGD.m. Run this program.
2 - It asks for data files. By default "data" folder is in the same directory as GSGD.m
3 - The results are stored in "Result" folder.
4 - For further analysis run Result\analyseData.m and Result\colorMapTry.m
